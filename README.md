## Introduction

Computational biology is a broad and expansive field of study centered mostly on the storage, processing and analysis of
biological data pertinent to many fields such as genetics, molecular biology and biophysics, among others. It uses applied
mathematics and statistics to aid in the analysis of large amounts of data, often requiring a way to output the results onto
graphs and other displays to aid in the visualization of the data and results of the analyses. The field is intricately linked
to computer science as it makes heavy use of computers to acquire, store and process all the data, as well as designing
algorithms to process it and analyze it.

The main motivation comes from the fact that many of the tasks performed by computational biologists are repetitive and
require several steps to achieve the final result. The goal of this language is to streamline the workflow and condense many of
these tasks into one or two simple instructions which will automatically output the results as desired. Another reason behind
creating such a language is that it allows biologists with little to no programming knowledge or experience to easily analyze
their own data without having to rely on computational biologists to do it for them. This way they can benefit immensely without
having to spend months trying to learn how to program or learn a complex programming language. Using simple and straightforward
functions, anyone can learn how to use this programming language in just one afternoon.
